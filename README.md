# Benchmark Cloud Database Perf Insight with sysbench


This exercise will leverage the multi-threaded benchmark too, [sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench), to evaluate managed database on all major cloud provides, including GCP, AWS, AlibabaCloud, Huawei Cloud and Tencent Cloud. 

By conducting a more systematic performance comparison of various cloud database vendors, the goal is to serve as a reference for developers and enterprises when selecting cloud databases. 

The initial stage will use sysbench *oltp_read_write* benchmark for PostgreSQL.
